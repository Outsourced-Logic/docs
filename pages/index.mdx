# Welcome to MultiOn AI 🚀!

### What is MultiOn?

MultiOn is your Personal AI agent that helps you with your daily tasks. The **MultiOn Chrome extension** re-imagines how you interact with the internet. We are excited for you to try it.

_Instead of you going to the information or interacting with websites, we let the information come to you to fully automate your web browsing experience_ 🤗

MultiOn works in two modes: **Step-by-step** and **Auto**.

- We recommend starting by using the **step-by-step** mode, as using MultiOn is like driving a race car 🏎️, and we want you to learn the controls before going full throttle!
- **Step-by-step** mode requires you to approve each next step & allows you to build trust with MultiOn and watch how it is working on different scenarios 🙂
