# ✨ Welcome to MultiOn AI

<Logo height={150} />

MultiOn is the Next-Gen Web AI Agent that can take actions on the internet on your behalf 🚀.

You can install our [**MultiOn Browser Client**](/installation.mdx) to reimagine how you interact with the internet and try it.

Unlock web automation capabilities and build custom AI Applications capable of performing complex web actions with just a few lines of code using the [MultiOn Agent API](API/browse.mdx).

_Instead of you interacting with websites or finding information online, MultiOn fully automates the web browsing experience to invert the traditional web paradigm_ 🤗

## Using MultiOn:

MultiOn works in two modes: **Step-by-step** and **Auto**.

- We recommend starting by using the **step-by-step** mode, as using MultiOn is like driving a race car 🏎️, and we want you to learn the controls before going full throttle!
- **Step-by-step** mode requires you to approve each next step & allows you to build trust with MultiOn and watch how it is working on different scenarios 🙂
